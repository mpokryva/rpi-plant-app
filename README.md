This is my first Android app. It tracks plant conditions, including moisture, light, and temperature,
using sensors connected to Raspberry Pi. The RPi and the phone communicate via a Firebase Realtime Database. The python script
named "raspi-adc-firebase.py" is what the RPi uses to transmit its data to the Firebase database.
